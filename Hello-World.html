<h2 id="hello-world-">Hello, World!</h2>
<p><em>Hello, World!</em> is a phrase uttered by many programmers, at a variety of times in their careers.</p>
<h3 id="the-very-beginnings">The very beginnings</h3>
<p><em>Hello, World</em> is the name of the first program written by many, as it is often the most <strong>simple</strong> program.</p>
<p>In Python, Perl, Ruby, and countless other scripting languages, <em>Hello, World</em> is a single line of code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Yet, as you enter the realm of low-level languages, the realm of computers themselves, <em>Hello, World</em> becomes an increasingly difficult program to write.</p>
<p>In most assembly languages, for instance, strings are not a first-class concept as they are in high-level languages. Writing a program to print the string &quot;Hello, World~&quot; to the screen may or may not be trivial. At a minimum, system calls require a bit of boilerplate code; at some layers, <em>Hello, World</em> might require implementing display drivers themselves!</p>
<p>Probably not. Point is, <code>1 + 1</code> is perhaps a better first program. Integers are perhaps easier to work with than strings; addition is perhaps better defined than printing to the string. What is it, then, that draws new programmers to <em>Hello, World</em>?</p>
<p><em>Hello, World</em> is <strong>interesting</strong>. Not necessarily <strong>simple</strong>, but <strong>interesting</strong>. Let that sink in for a minute.</p>
<h3 id="the-experienced-learning">The experienced learning</h3>
<p>I am a decent programmer. Many programmers are better than I am. Many others can learn from me. I wrote my first <em>Hello, World</em> program years ago. What am I doing, writing one now?</p>
<p>Think about <em>Hello, World</em> on a deeper level. Not the program, everyone has thought about the program, but the words &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;World.&quot;</p>
<p>Note the comma. When we write &quot;Hello, World&quot;, both the phrase and the program, we are <strong>addressing</strong> the world itself. (For readers interested in poetry, this is called &quot;apostrophe&quot;).</p>
<p>We are welcoming ourself into the World. The World of Python. The World of Perl. The World of Blogging. The World of Programming. The World of <em>Anything <strong>New</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Simply because I was welcomed into the world of programming years ago does not mean I was also welcomed into the world of blogging.</p>
<h3 id="shehecheyanu">Shehecheyanu</h3>
<p>Judiasm has a prayer, the Shehecheyanu (literally, &quot;Who has given us life&quot;), for new experiences. Generally, it is said when someone does something new for the first time (in a while). There are a variety of traditions surrounding its usage; I&#39;m not particularly familiar with them. (If you&#39;re interested, read its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shehecheyanu">Wikipedia</a> page.)</p>
<p>I propose that <em>Hello, World</em> is the Shehecheyanu of programmers. I may criticise the traditional reasons for saying the Shehecheyanu, and I may criticise the traditional reasons for writing a <em>Hello, World</em> program (as opposed to, for instance, FizzBuzz), but these traditions are ingrained in Jewish and programmer cultures respectively. If you would like to welcome yourself to <em>anything</em>, who am I to prevent you from reciting Shehecheyanu or writing <em>Hello, World</em>? I, for one, continue to write these programs out of sheer tradition.</p>
